## MonadRelief – Real-time Micro-Donations on Monad L1

### Technical Architecture
- **Smart contracts (Monad L1)**: `MonadRelief` routes micro-donations to verified beneficiaries instantly and emits events for full transparency. Simple native-asset MVP with ERC20 variant for stablecoins.
- **Oracles and FX**: Price feed oracles (Chainlink-equivalent or native Monad oracle) to target $0.01 minimum by converting USD to token amount client-side; backend verifies bounds.
- **Backend (TypeScript/Express + WebSocket)**: API for donation intent, stats cache, event indexer, and fiat/stablecoin off-ramp integration hooks (UPI, wallets). Broadcasts live stats to clients.
- **Wallets**: Donor-side wallets (browser wallets, mobile); beneficiary multisigs/custodial wallets with instant disbursement. Governance multisig for verification.
- **Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)**: Donation UI, beneficiary directory, live stats, proof of transparency with on-chain links.

### User Flow (Donor → Transaction → Beneficiary)
1. Donor selects disaster and beneficiary, enters amount (>= $0.01).
2. Frontend fetches FX quote, constructs transaction to `donate(beneficiaryId)` on Monad.
3. Transaction confirms in ~instant finality; `Donation` and `Disbursement` events emitted.
4. Backend indexer updates stats; WebSocket pushes live totals to all clients.
5. Beneficiary wallet receives funds immediately; off-ramp via UPI/mobile wallets as needed.

### Governance and Verification
- Governance multisig (DAO/coalition of NGOs + local government) controls `registerBeneficiary` and `setVerified`.
- Onboarding policy: KYC/KYB of NGOs, community leaders, and local gov wallets; public registry on-chain and in-app with proofs.
- Emergency revocation: Governance can unverify beneficiaries instantly.

### Scalability and Reliability
- Monad’s parallel execution and low-latency pipeline allow 10k+ TPS bursts with negligible fees; donations are tiny (pennies) yet viable.
- Simple contract logic (no storage-heavy loops) minimizes contention and leverages parallelism.
- Backend is stateless and horizontally scalable; WebSocket hubs fan out live stats.

### Live Transparency
- All donations and disbursements are recorded on-chain via events.
- Explorer links per beneficiary; per-donor receipts with tx hash and timestamp.

### Stablecoins and Fiat Off-ramps
- Support native stablecoins on Monad; contract ERC20 variant streams token donations.
- Backend provides payout hooks for UPI and mobile wallets via licensed partners; not custodial to donations but can provide beneficiary settlement metadata.

### Example Case Study: $1 → $1,000,000 in < 1 hour
- 1,000,000 donors donate $1 each during a flood alert.
- With Monad’s ~10k–50k TPS effective throughput, confirmations complete within minutes; disbursements are instantaneous.
- Fees remain sub-cent, maximizing relief value. Funds are usable immediately by verified local NGOs via mobile wallets or UPI off-ramps.

### Why Monad vs Ethereum, Solana, Banking
- **Monad**: Parallel execution + high throughput + instant finality + ultra-low fees → viable real-time micro-philanthropy at global scale.
- **Ethereum L1**: High fees and limited throughput make $0.01 donations impractical; L2s add bridging UX and finality delays.
- **Solana**: High throughput but historical liveness concerns and different execution guarantees; Monad’s design targets consistent parallelism and low-latency confirmation.
- **Traditional banking**: Cross-border micro-payments are slow (days), expensive, and opaque; no global real-time settlement or transparent audit trail.

### Contracts and Repos
- Contract: `blockchain/contracts/MonadRelief.sol`
- Backend: `backend/` (Express + WS, ethers indexer)
- Frontend: `frontend/` (Next.js + Tailwind)

### Next Steps
- Add ERC20 stablecoin donation flow and FX guardrails.
- Stand up indexing service with durable DB for analytics.
- Formalize governance multisig and verification workflows.
